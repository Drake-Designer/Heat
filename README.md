## Project Overview

Heat is a dance-funk band based in Dublin, inspired by the sounds of Daft Punk, Chromeo, and especially Franc Moody. Our music is original, full of groove and positive vibes.. definitely made to get people dancing!

The band started in 2019 through the friendship of Shaneo (vocals), Ati (bass), and Jorge (keys). JT (guitar) joined in 2020, and Dario (drums) completed the lineup in 2023. We’ve been rehearsing for years at Yellow Door Music Studio, recording our tracks both in the studio and at home, and playing live in venues like Bello Bar and The Sugar Club.

> <strong>This website was created to introduce my band Heat to a wider audience, share our music, promote our upcoming gigs, and make it easy for people to book us for live shows.</strong>

### Favicon Creation & Integration

To create a full set of favicons compatible with all major platforms (desktop, Android, iOS), I have used the online tool [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net).

**Steps:**

1. Uploaded the custom Heat logo.
2. Used default settings for modern browser and mobile support.
3. Extracted files into `assets/favicons/`.
4. Added the generated `<link>` tags to the `<head>` of `index.html`.

## Testing & Bug Fixes

❌ Bug #1 – Anchor links didn't scroll correctly to the right section

When clicking on the navigation links like "The Band", "Music", or "Gallery", the scroll did not work properly. Sometimes the section was too high and hidden behind the navbar, and other times it was too low.

This problem made the site feel broken, especially on small screens or when using the mobile menu. It was hard to understand what caused it. I lost almost a full day trying different ideas and also contacted Tutor Support for help.

In the end, the solution was very simple. I added the following CSS to give the body and section elements enough padding from the top, equal to the height of the navbar (72.89px):

body {
padding-top: 72.89px;
}

section {
padding-top: 72.89px;
}
