### Favicon Creation & Integration

To create a full set of favicons compatible with all major platforms (desktop, Android, iOS), I used the online tool [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net).

**Steps:**

1. Uploaded the custom Heat logo.
2. Used default settings for modern browser and mobile support.
3. Extracted files into `assets/favicons/`.
4. Added the generated `<link>` tags to the `<head>` of `index.html`.

**Screenshots:**

> Mention tools used to validate HTML and CSS (e.g. [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)).  
> Include any known bugs, how they were fixed, or why they remain unresolved.
