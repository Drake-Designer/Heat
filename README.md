## Project Overview

Heat is a dance-funk band based in Dublin, inspired by the sounds of Daft Punk, Chromeo, and especially Franc Moody. Our music is original, full of groove and positive vibes.. definitely made to get people dancing!

The band started in 2019 through the friendship of Shaneo (vocals), Ati (bass), and Jorge (keys). JT (guitar) joined in 2020, and Dario (drums) completed the lineup in 2023. We’ve been rehearsing for years at Yellow Door Music Studio, recording our tracks both in the studio and at home, and playing live in venues like Bello Bar and The Sugar Club.

> <strong>This website was created to introduce my band Heat to a wider audience, share our music, promote our upcoming gigs, and make it easy for people to book us for live shows.</strong>

### Favicon Creation & Integration

To create a full set of favicons compatible with all major platforms (desktop, Android, iOS), I have used the online tool [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net).

**Steps:**

1. Uploaded the custom Heat logo.
2. Used default settings for modern browser and mobile support.
3. Extracted files into `assets/favicons/`.
4. Added the generated `<link>` tags to the `<head>` of `index.html`.

**Screenshots:**
